                <h2>Our Purpose</h2>

                <p>
                    Bodji Schools Alumni Association (BSAA) is a non-profit organization established to bring together
                    former students of Bodji Dirmadji and Bodji Cheqorsa schools located in Oromia Regional State 
                    of Ethiopia. The purpose of the organization is to support the schools and the surrounding communities 
                    professionally, financially, materially, as well as providing resources towards promoting and strengthening the 
                    educational, social, and economic developmental activities.

                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Probably, many of us may not know the historical background of the present Bodji Dirmaji school. 
                    Unless we understand the prior history of what has been happening, we may not be able to appreciate
                    what we have today and at the same time, it may be considered as if we are ignoring those who have 
                    paid a huge sacrifice for us so that the school is able to function for generations. Any institutions 
                    or organizations that are nationally or internationally acquired respectful reputation have their own 
                    history from inception to recognition. In the same way, Bodji Dirmaji school has its own unique history 
                    that led the school to produce thousands of local and international professionals. Many high ranking 
                    government personnel who have been serving the country, exceptionally gifted people who have been/are/ 
                    serving in the international organizations, internationally competent medical doctors and many more gifted 
                    and brilliant young people have been the product of Bodji Dirmaji school.
                    
                    For the inception and growth of Bodji Dirmaji school, the establishment of evangelical church at Bodji (Bodji Karkarro) 
                    played a very important role in the making of the historical school.
                    
                    Prior to the arrival of evangelical church at Bodji, the Ethiopian government (Abyssinia) has established 
                    the Ethiopian Orthodox church [St. Mary] after the same already established Orthodox church in Naqamte, Wollega. 
                    As we all know, the objective of the Ethiopian Orthodox church in that region was mainly to contribute to the 
                    facilitation of political system of the Abyssinian government so that the area could submit to the ruling 
                    class of that day. Consequently, the establishment of Bodji Dirmaji St. Mary Orthodox church did not contribute 
                    to the betterment of the people except using the church as an agent to advance the interest of the ruling class.
                    
                    After numerous stiff resistances against the arrival of evangelical pioneers, the time has come when they 
                    could not resist any more and the evangelical pioneers have arrived at Bodji. Evangelical church history clearly
                    tells us how tough it was to penetrate to reach the western Oromia (by then, known as Wallagga xeqilayi gizat). 
                    We encourage you to read “Bodji Dirmajii Seenaa Keessatti”.
                    
                    The first evangelical arrivals were wise enough on how to introduce the Afan Oromo in a way that it does 
                    not start immediate violence in the region as the government was working hard to make Amharic the national 
                    language and was suppressing the Afan Oromo with all possible methods. The evangelical pioneers tried to
                    worship at Bodji St. Mary Ethiopian Orthodox church during the morning worship service and then introduce 
                    the Oromo Bible and Oromo hymn in the afternoon at individuals’ homes. This was happened just in order 
                    to avoid violence and even also with good intention of supporting evangelism. 
                    
                    Unfortunately, this has been resulted in a vehement resistance from the priests of St. Mary Orthodox church 
                    which even led to the extent of not to share burial cemeteries with the few minority evangelicals 
                    (note that there was no denominational name). As a result, there was a time when these evangelical marginal 
                    Christians walked many hours to Nedjo district for appeal leaving a corpse in their home for days to get 
                    a burial place as the St. Mary Ethiopian Orthodox church at Bodji refused to let them bury in the yard of their church. 
                    Despite of all the resistances, the service in Afan Oromo got upper hand gradually and evangelical churches were 
                    established at Bodji Dirmaji and the surroundings.
                    
                    The evangelical pioneers of those days inspired the people on the importance of using their own language (Afan Oromo) 
                    and have established small local literacy schools where some of them became the first teachers and eventually it turned 
                    to formal school.
                    
                    As the number of evangelical churches increased around Bodji Dirmaji area, starting small literacy school in the church became part of the mission in most of local churches. Those literacy schools were comprised of all the needs of local people. This has been part of the service of the church for many years in the Western Synod to the extent of establishing a literacy department and which exists to this very day.
                    From its very inception, the evangelical church in Bodji Dirmaji area and other places never hesitated to change the emerging eradication of Afan Oromo and in the process replacing by Amharic in which they were successful to some degree but the Bodji Dirmaji area did relentless resistance to rescue Afan Oromo from its enemies.
                    The contribution of evangelical churches to the establishment of formal school at Bodji Dirmaji was a backbone for the Bodji schools we see today. As a result, the local people of this region had/have/ a full confidence to use their language (Afan Oromo).

                    The huge question we need to ask ourselves today is though, how is this historical and ever life changing school is doing today? 
                    Our forefathers and mothers have sacrificed a lot to lay the foundation of education in that particular area. Today in the 21st century,
                    exposure to modern education is just a basic necessity. It is our historical duty to rekindle the education light that once our pioneers 
                    have started during those difficult days.

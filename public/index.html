                <h2>Our Purpose</h2>

                <p>
                    Bodji Schools Alumni Association (BSAA) is a non-profit organization established to bring together
                    former students of Bodji Dirmadji and Bodji Cheqorsa schools located in Oromia Regional State 
                    of Ethiopia. The purpose of the organization is to support the schools and the surrounding communities 
                    professionally, financially, materially, as well as providing resources towards promoting and strengthening the 
                    educational, social, and economic developmental activities.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Probably, many of us may not know the historical background of the present Bodji Dirmaji school. 
                    Unless we understand the prior history of what has been happening, we may not be able to appreciate
                    what we have today and at the same time, it may be considered as if we are ignoring those who have 
                    paid a huge sacrifice for us so that the school is able to function for generations. Any institutions 
                    or organizations that are nationally or internationally acquired respectful reputation have their own 
                    history from inception to recognition. In the same way, Bodji Dirmaji school has its own unique history 
                    that led the school to produce thousands of local and international professionals. Many high ranking 
                    government personnel who have been serving the country, exceptionally gifted people who have been/are/ 
                    serving in the international organizations, internationally competent medical doctors and many more gifted 
                    and brilliant young people have been the product of Bodji Dirmaji school.
                    
                    For the inception and growth of Bodji Dirmaji school, the establishment of evangelical church at Bodji (Bodji Karkarro) 
                    played a very important role in the making of the historical school.
                    
                    Prior to the arrival of evangelical church at Bodji, the Ethiopian government (Abyssinia) has established 
                    the Ethiopian Orthodox church [St. Mary] after the same already established Orthodox church in Naqamte, Wollega. 
                    As we all know, the objective of the Ethiopian Orthodox church in that region was mainly to contribute to the 
                    facilitation of political system of the Abyssinian government so that the area could submit to the ruling 
                    class of that day. Consequently, the establishment of Bodji Dirmaji St. Mary Orthodox church did not contribute 
                    to the betterment of the people except using the church as an agent to advance the interest of the ruling class.
                    
                    After numerous stiff resistances against the arrival of evangelical pioneers, the time has come when they 
                    could not resist any more and the evangelical pioneers have arrived at Bodji. Evangelical church history clearly
                    tells us how tough it was to penetrate to reach the western Oromia (by then, known as Wallagga xeqilayi gizat). 
                    We encourage you to read “Bodji Dirmajii Seenaa Keessatti”.
                    
                    The first evangelical arrivals were wise enough on how to introduce the Afan Oromo in a way that it does 
                    not start immediate violence in the region as the government was working hard to make Amharic the national 
                    language and was suppressing the Afan Oromo with all possible methods. The evangelical pioneers tried to
                    worship at Bodji St. Mary Ethiopian Orthodox church during the morning worship service and then introduce 
                    the Oromo Bible and Oromo hymn in the afternoon at individuals’ homes. This was happened just in order 
                    to avoid violence and even also with good intention of supporting evangelism. 
                    
                    Unfortunately, this has been resulted in a vehement resistance from the priests of St. Mary Orthodox church 
                    which even led to the extent of not to share burial cemeteries with the few minority evangelicals 
                    (note that there was no denominational name). As a result, there was a time when these evangelical marginal 
                    Christians walked many hours to Nedjo district for appeal leaving a corpse in their home for days to get 
                    a burial place as the St. Mary Ethiopian Orthodox church at Bodji refused to let them bury in the yard of their 
                    church.Despite of all the resistances, the service in Afan Oromo got upper hand gradually and evangelical churches
                    were established at Bodji Dirmaji and the surroundings.
                    
                    The evangelical pioneers of those days inspired the people on the importance of using their own language (Afan Oromo) 
                    and have established small local literacy schools where some of them became the first teachers and eventually it 
                    turned to formal school.
                    
                    As the number of evangelical churches increased around Bodji Dirmaji area, starting small literacy school in the 
                    church became part of the mission in most of local churches. Those literacy schools were comprised of all the 
                    needs of local people. This has been part of the service of the church for many years in the Western Synod to 
                    the extent of establishing a literacy department and which exists to this very day.
                    
                    From its very inception, the evangelical church in Bodji Dirmaji area and other places never hesitated to change 
                    the emerging eradication of Afan Oromo and in the process replacing by Amharic in which they were successful to 
                    some degree but the Bodji Dirmaji area did relentless resistance to rescue Afan Oromo from its enemies.
                    The contribution of evangelical churches to the establishment of formal school at Bodji Dirmaji was a backbone 
                    for the Bodji schools we see today. As a result, the local people of this region had/have/ a full confidence 
                    to use their language (Afan Oromo).

                    The huge question we need to ask ourselves today is though, how is this historical and ever life changing school 
                    is doing today? Our forefathers and mothers have sacrificed a lot to lay the foundation of education in that 
                    particular area. Today in the 21st century, exposure to modern education is just a basic necessity. 
                    It is our historical duty to rekindle the education light that once our pioneers have started during those 
                    difficult days.

                <h2> Memories and Aspirations for Bodji Dirmaji High School </h2>

                <p>
                    <i> By Wagari Saqata Iticha </i> 
                 </p>
                
                <p>
                    
                    Each of us live with past memories, present challenges, and future hopes. Most of the time, our past memories 
                    influence our present and future lives.  Our shared past is what binds us together and keeps us working together 
                    for a brighter future. Being born in Bodji Dirmaji, the most historical place in western Oromia, has left me 
                    and hopefully everyone else who has lived there with many memories.

                    There is a natural pride and sense of belongingness attached to one’s birthplace and hometown.  
                    We remember the wonders and marvels of the places we lived with deep sentimentality that we eagerly share with 
                    all who never had the privilege of calling a place like our beloved Bodji their own home. Bodji is a remarkable 
                    place in Oromia with a rich history. Bodjji is the birthplace of modern Christianity within our country and the 
                    center of the beginnings of modern education in the entire region. Bodjji has produced many intellectuals who 
                    have served at national and international levels. My appreciation of Bodji growing up has always been about 
                    the people I met and played with every day, but as I grew older I recognized that our beloved Bodji was much 
                    more than that.  The history of Bodji and the noble contributions it has made to our country and all of Oromia 
                    are not sufficiently known.  For example, out of Bodji came the creativity and talent of the Burqaa Bodji founded 
                    and  led by Obbo Daniel Namara and Obbo Hambissa Dheressa  during those dark days of our time,  the time when many 
                    Oromos were ashamed of their identity. Several young boys and girls of our region stood up with courage, bravery, 
                    and determination to share the rich culture of the Oromo people. They took this talent to the center of 
                    Oromia (Finfinne) where, the identity, culture, language, and  customs of the Oromo population had been nearly lost. 
                    These determined young Bodji children brought back the rich history and culture of the Oromo and gave us back 
                    our identity and pride. They played a vital role in helping keep the Oromo people proud of its rich history 
                    and culture. 

                    Like most of you do, I have many memories of my birthplace and childhood home - too many to share in this space. 
                    So I keep my focus on Bodji Dirmaji High School, the source for wealth of treasured memories.  The importance of 
                    education was evident in many Bodji families. I began my education at Bodji as a second grader in 1963 Ethiopian Calendar.
                    I had already learned to write, read, and do some basic mathematics at a local Adventist church, and from my older 
                    brother at home. My grades during the first semester of my 2nd grade education exceeded the school’s expectations. 
                    As a result I got promoted to the third grade along with two of my fellow classmates.  I was so inspired  that I 
                    worked even harder and subsequently earned praises for my efforts over the years by the time we reached the 6th grade
                    and 8th grade, we had to sit for the national exam.  Those of us from the rural areas had to sleep in the school 
                    the night before the exams.  That amazed me because there were so many of us who had to sleep at the school! 
                    We did not really get much sleep those nights nevertheless we all sat for the hard exams the next day and most 
                    of us did very well.

                    Many of us went through many challenges to learn and obtain our education. Just like many other rural students, 
                    I had to walk an hour and a half to the school and another hour and a half back home on foot each day. 
                    Sometimes, we walk without adequate footwear or none at all.  Upon returning home after several chores 
                    I had to sit down to study using those often smokey kerosene lamps until midnight.  After a few hours of 
                    sleep, we would rise at 05:30 a.m. to walk the 3 hours to and from school for another day of learning. 
                    School began at 8 a.m. and ended at 4 p.m.. Most of us spent our break and lunch time in the shade of a tree, 
                    chatting together without actually eating a lunch or any snacks. The concept of lunch box did not exist. 
                    Sometimes some of us who were more fortunate, received 20 cents for a cup of tea and a loaf of bread, or just 
                    10 cents for only the bread.  Obbo Mamo Dasta, and Obbo Jogora Gamada were the well-known owners of “Mana Shaye” 
                    and are always remembered by all of us. Many days we would go to Mamo’s to get a piece of bread, paying 10 cents 
                    if we have or get one by just promising to pay later.  Mamo would sell us bread, but would always make sure we 
                    each had to pay the money back for the amount of bread we took. Other times, we would work together, especially 
                    friends and students from the same area, ten to fifteen of us would take turns bringing coffee and corn to feed 
                    ourselves at lunch time (2 cups of coffee each and boiled corn (mullu) prepared by one of the residents around 
                    the school whom we paid 50 cents each every month for providing space, preparing the coffee and the corn. 
                    The “mullu” and coffee was delicious, but it was the socialization aspect of it that is cherished since it 
                    brought the group members together as family.

                    One of my greatest memories of our Bodji history is the efforts of our forefathers. Bodji High School, the mother 
                    to all of us, was not built by the government, but rather by our forefathers who had the vision, determination, 
                    and generosity to make the sacrifices necessary to build that school for all of us and the future generation. 
                    They carried “Laaxaa” and “Maagara” the two most essential building structures made from the eucalyptus trees on 
                    their shoulders, brought chaff from xafii (cidii), prepared mud, and many sacrificed some of their modest family 
                    finances to buy other materials while others gave physical assistance even in the midst of farming season 
                    (like dhooqee dhiituu, manna maraguu, and ‘lassanuu’). They began building at the end of a school year and after 
                    only three months he school was ready to welcome students at the beginning of the new school year. 

                    That is the kind of legacy that lives on and helps us remember our selfless and magnanimous forefathers and 
                    inspires us today to do our part, thinking how we may bring our beloved Bodji School to the forefront  of our 
                    hearts and thoughts, so that we can find the ways how to contribute to keeping Bodji schools thriving for all 
                    students. Feed the passion you have, share the spark, and fan the flames of that passion into a major fire to 
                    make the changes necessary for the future of Bodji schools.
